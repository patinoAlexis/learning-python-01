# The most important observations
# 1- We need to include always the self parameter at the start of the method definition.
# 2- When printing numerical values or i also imagine, other values we can transform them
# into a string with using ":" and followed of how it should look like.
# like in the example used ",.2f" to show the number with 2 decimal places and with commas.
# 3- It seems that pythong prioritizes more the objects than the 6-classes.
# you can create 6-classes and not define their properties. And even you can assing new properties
# to the objects of the class.

# 4- Inheritance works mostly as expected from other languages, nothing too crazy
